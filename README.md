# Owl
An app that helps you keep in touch with people in your life.

It does this by:
  </br>-Letting you create or import contacts.
  </br>-Store info about their contact details, prefered apps for communication, and desired contact frequency.
  </br>-Producing a notification at the desired frequency which (1) provides a menu of pre-packaged messages to choose from and (2) launches the preferred app of choice with the chosen message as a draft message to your contact.
  </br>-The list of pre-packaged messages can be extended by users with custom messages, and some additional administrative functions are avaiable.
