    <string name="contacts_instructions">Owl makes it easy to keep in touch with the people you care about. Start by creating or importing contacts for Owl to help with.

    \n\nSee Options > About Owl for more info.</string>
    <string name="message_instructions">Owl comes with messages to start from, so you don\'t need to start from scratch thinking about what to say.
        You can also create your own messages to add to the list of pre-packaged ones to choose from.

    \n\nSee Options > About Owl for more info.</string>

    <!-- Owl app info -->
    <string name="app_info"><b>Why Owl?</b>

        \n\n\nDo you ever think of someone you care about, without reaching out to let them know?

        \n\n\Do you feel yourself neglecting family members or drifting apart from old friends?

        \n\n\Do you wish you were better at keeping in touch with the important people in your life?

        \n\nIf your answer is to any of these is "yes", you\'re not alone. Owl is here to help.

        \n\nReceiving a message or call can brighten a person\'s day. It shows that someone cares. Someone thought about them. Someone took the time out of their life to reach out. This act can keep our bonds strong and our relationships alive.

        \n\nFor some of us, however, sending a message or giving them a call takes a lot of energy. Whether you\'re someone who spends a lot of effort thinking up what to say, you have an introverted nature that makes regular messaging difficult, or you could just use some assistance in staying on schedule in your communications, Owl helps by:

        \n\n *Notifying you to reach out to people on a regular schedule
	    \n *Providing pre-written messages to choose from
        \n *Serving up your chosen message in an app of your choice

        \n\n<b>How to Owl?</b>

        \n\nJust add the people you send Owls to, their preferred messaging app, and how often you want to receive Owl reminders (along with their phone number or other info needed by the preferred messaging app, such as their Skype name).

        \n\nWhen you get an Owl notification for someone, tap it and you\'ll be taken to a menu of messages to choose from. Tap a message, and you\'ll be taken to that person\'s preferred messaging app along with the message you selected. Modify or add to the message, or send it as is. You can also snooze Owl notifications for a day, or just dismiss them until the next one.

        \n\nOptionally, you can import contacts from your phone to easily get their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. You can also add your own messages to the menu of pre-written ones.

        \n\n<b>Thanks Owl!</b>

        \n\nExisting Owl features are and always will be free. Owl is supported by helping keep connections strong and putting positive energy into the world.

        \n\nIf you\'d like to support Owl, you are encouraged to do good deeds, donate to a deserving charity, or simply do well in keeping in touch with those that you care about. Share your positive actions, personal stories of maintaining or improving connections, or accounts of how Owl has helped you with the #gavetwohoots hashtag to spread the word and encourage others to take on further positive action. Rating Owl on the app store is also appreciated.

        \n\n<b>Thanks for using Owl. Happy Owling!</b>
